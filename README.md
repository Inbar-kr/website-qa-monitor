## Project Overview
qa-monitor is an end-to-end automated testing suite built with Playwright designed to monitor the functionality, performance, and responsiveness of the Demoblaze e-commerce website. It runs cross-browser tests simulating real user interactions, validating UI elements, checking for console errors, and measuring page performance.

The project supports multiple browsers and device emulations to ensure consistent user experience across platforms. It integrates with GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI) and generates detailed HTML reports for test results.

## Key Features
- **Homepage Tests:** Verify homepage availability, page title, navigation bar, and featured product listings.
- **Performance Testing:** Measure page load times and performance metrics.
- **Console Error Detection:** Capture and fail tests if browser console logs contain errors or warnings.
- **Responsiveness Checks:** Validate the siteâ€™s layout and elements at various screen sizes and device emulations.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Runs tests on Chromium, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and mobile device emulations.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated tests run on GitHub Actions with a matrix strategy across browsers.
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generates HTML reports and screenshots on test failures.

## Tech Stack
- **Testing Framework:** Playwright Test  
- **Languages:** TypeScript / JavaScript
